# JFrog

Coder and JFrog work together to provide seamless security and compliance for
your development environments. With Coder, you can automatically authenticate
every workspace to use a central Artifactory.

In this page we will give examples in terms of a Docker template for simplicity,
but the same concepts apply to any compute platform.

## Installing jf

The easiest way to install the JFrog CLI is to run the following command:

```sh
curl -fL https://install-cli.jfrog.io | sh
```
